"""Output-side active-content neutralizer -- the a10 (export / formula injection) fix.

Applied to content socxen WRITES back through the bridge (case notes, alert/case updates) so a payload
planted in telemetry cannot fire when that persisted artifact is later exported. Scope is deliberately
narrow -- "do no harm; stop the obvious; document the exotic" -- to two ACTIVE-content forms:

  1. FORMULA cells (=HYPERLINK(...), @SUM(...), =cmd|'..'!A0): quote-prefixed inert, and any URL on the
     formula's line is defanged. Stops CSV / formula injection on spreadsheet export.
  2. MARKDOWN LINKS in the standard inline form [text](target): the target is defanged (host -> [.],
     scheme -> hxxp, javascript: -> [:]). Stops a clickable phishing link. Legitimate links are mutated
     too -- the accepted compromise, since a deterministic pass cannot tell a legit link from a
     malicious one. Other link forms are NOT covered; see the residuals below.
  3. SECRETS / STRUCTURED PII (the class-D redaction fix, #88 / assessment F-04): a credential or
     structured government identifier planted in telemetry must not survive verbatim into a persisted
     case note / export -- a durable, broader-audience artifact. Prompt-only redaction was measured
     leaking 100% (red-team d01/d03), so this is deterministic. Each match is replaced with a typed
     placeholder [REDACTED:<kind>] so the report still says "a credential was here" without the value.

  neutralize_output(text) -> (clean_text, notes)     # notes: list of {"type","original"} that changed

DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS (out of scope, by decision):
  - a BARE URL typed in prose (not a markdown link, not on a formula line) is left UNTOUCHED -- defanging
    every URL would mangle the legit reference links analysts write in notes (do harm).
  - LINK FORMS OTHER THAN THE STANDARD INLINE ONE are not defanged: a CommonMark title
    ([t](url "title")), whitespace padding inside the parens, reference-style definitions
    ([ref]: url), GFM autolinks (<url>), and raw HTML anchors. Tracked in #119. The matcher covers
    the form a model overwhelmingly writes; the rest are a known gap, not a claim.
  - an ALL-ALPHABETIC value after a BARE LINE BREAK ("Recovered credential\ncorrecthorsebatterystaple")
    is not caught: after a line break, a word with no digit and no delimiter is indistinguishable from
    recommendation prose ("credential\nRotation is required immediately"), and redacting it would eat
    real analyst text. Labelled (`password: X`), wrapped (`X` / "X"), and markdown-TABLE forms are all
    caught regardless of shape -- this residual is only the bare-newline-plus-dictionary-word case.
  - FREE-FORM PII (names, home addresses) and DATE-shaped values (DOB) are NOT redacted: a home address
    is not reliably regex-detectable, and a date is indistinguishable from the timestamp on every log
    line (redacting it would gut legitimate reports). These stay a best-effort SKILL-prompt ask.
  - the operator's own on-screen chat is not a sink here: they are authorized to read the raw telemetry,
    so display crosses no trust boundary. This gates the WRITE path (what gets persisted), not the console.

Redaction is HIGH-SPECIFICITY only -- format/prefix/checksum/label-anchored, never blind entropy -- so a
hash, UUID, IP, or hostname in a legitimate report passes through untouched (see the FP corpus in tests).

    # ORDER MATTERS. Link defang runs BEFORE redaction, not after. A credential-shaped query parameter
    # (`[reset](https://evil/login?token=abc123).`) puts both controls on one span, and whichever runs
    # first wins: with redaction first, its value match consumed the link's closing ")" and _MD_LINK_RE
    # could no longer see a link -- leaving a LIVE clickable phishing URL in a persisted note (worse than
    # no redactor at all). Defanging first makes that impossible for EVERY value shape rather than for the
    # shapes a fixture happens to cover: by the time the redactor runs, the host is already inert, so
    # whatever it consumes it cannot re-arm a link. Redaction still sees the query value verbatim (defang
    # rewrites the scheme and host, never the query string), so nothing is lost.
